# odin-recipes
The Odin Project Recipe Project given at the end of the HTML fundamentals portion. This recipe project was meant to allow the student to practice fundamentals learned up to this point. 
The student created html pages from scratch that included the use of the header and body tag. In the body tag various header tags were used to appropriately show levels of importance. The anchor tag was used from an index page to link to three different recipes. 
The recipe pages were located in a seperate recipe folder. Each recipe page included an H1 tag for the recipe name. An image of the meal, via relative reference. A description of the recipe which included an absolute reference to the page that the recipe was found on. An unordered list of ingredients. An ordered list of steps to complete the recipe. A relative reference back to the index page.
